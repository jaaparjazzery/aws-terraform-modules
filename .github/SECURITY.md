## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

###  Private Disclosure (Preferred)

1. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue**
2. Go to https://github.com/jaaparjazzery/aws-terraform-modules/security/advisories/new
3. Click "Report a vulnerability"
4. Provide detailed information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### ðŸ“§ Email Disclosure (Alternative)

If you prefer email, send details to: security@quidgee.com

**Include:**
- Subject: "[SECURITY] Description"
- Detailed description
- Steps to reproduce
- Your contact information

## What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment:** Within 5 business days
3. **Status Updates:** Weekly until resolved
4. **Resolution:** We aim to fix critical issues within 30 days

## Security Best Practices

When using these modules:

###  DO

- **Use latest versions** - Always use the latest stable release
- **Enable encryption** - Use KMS encryption for sensitive data
- **Restrict access** - Use least privilege IAM policies
- **Private subnets** - Place sensitive resources in private subnets
- **Enable logging** - Turn on CloudWatch Logs and VPC Flow Logs
- **Scan regularly** - Use tfsec, checkov, or Trivy
- **Rotate credentials** - Regularly rotate secrets and keys
- **Use HTTPS** - Enable SSL/TLS for all endpoints
- **Enable MFA** - Require MFA for privileged operations
- **Review security groups** - Minimize open ports

###  DON'T

- **Hardcode secrets** - Never put passwords or keys in code
- **Commit sensitive data** - Don't commit terraform.tfstate
- **Use default credentials** - Always change default passwords
- **Disable encryption** - Don't turn off encryption features
- **Open to world** - Avoid 0.0.0.0/0 in security groups
- **Skip updates** - Don't ignore security advisories
- **Ignore warnings** - Address security scan findings
- **Use root credentials** - Don't use AWS root account
- **Share IAM keys** - Don't share access keys
- **Disable logging** - Keep audit logs enabled

## Security Features

Our modules include security by default:

### Encryption
-  EBS volumes encrypted
-  RDS storage encrypted
-  S3 server-side encryption
-  EKS secrets encryption

### Network Security
-  Private subnets for databases
-  Security groups with least privilege
-  NAT Gateways for outbound only
-  No direct internet access to sensitive resources

### Access Control
-  IAM roles (no access keys)
-  IRSA for EKS workloads
-  Instance profiles for EC2
-  Least privilege policies

### Compliance
-  IMDSv2 enforcement
-  Public access blocking (S3)
-  Deletion protection
-  Backup retention

## Known Security Considerations

### Default Configurations

1. **Database Passwords:**
   - Must be provided via variables
   - Should use AWS Secrets Manager in production
   - Never commit to version control

2. **SSH Keys:**
   - Optional for EC2 instances
   - Use SSM Session Manager instead when possible
   - Restrict key access if used

3. **API Endpoints:**
   - EKS API can be public by default
   - Configure `endpoint_private_access` and `public_access_cidrs`
   - Use VPN or bastion for production

## Security Scanning

We run automated security scans:

- **tfsec** - Terraform security scanner
- **checkov** - Policy-as-code scanner
- **trivy** - Infrastructure security scanner
- **Dependabot** - Dependency updates
- **GitHub Code Scanning** - Static analysis

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0:** Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2:** Acknowledgment sent
3. **Day 3-7:** Initial assessment
4. **Day 7-30:** Patch development
5. **Day 30:** Public disclosure (if resolved)
